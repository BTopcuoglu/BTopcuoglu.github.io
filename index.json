They predict which Amazon product you will buy next, how much value Bitcoin will lose in the coming month or when the cherry blossoms will peak in Washington DC.\nML models are now being used to make high stake decisions by:\n The judicial system to make parole decisions. Weather forecasts to predict air quality. The financial system to decide who gets a loan. Hospitals to automoate interpretation of the EKGs and detection of a lung nodules from chest X-rays.  Can we use ML models in the microbiome field?\nMicrobiome field is growing at an unprecedented rate. There is an increasing demand for methods that identify associations between members of the microbiome and their ecosystem such as an animal host or a soil habitat.\nIt is unlikely that a single species can explain the change we see in an ecosystem. Instead, subsets of those communities, in relation to one another and to their environment account for that.\nMachine learning (ML) methods are effective at recognizing and highlighting patterns in complex microbial datasets. Therefore, researchers have started to explore the utility of ML models that use microbiome associated biomarkers to predict changes in an ecosystem using ML such as:\n Modeling soil microbiome to predict crop productivity. Modeling muman microbiome to detect colorectal cancer or a Clostridium difficile infection.  Problems with ML in the microbiome field\n It is great that we are using new tools to understand microbial systems however, currentlythe field’s use of ML lacks clarity and consistency on which methods are used and how these methods are implemented.\n There is a trend towards using more complex ML models such as random or neural networks without a discussion on if this is necessary for the goals of a study.\n The lack of transparency on modeling methodology and model selection negatively impact model reproducibility and reliability.\n  We need to strive toward better machine learning practices by:\n Implementing consistent, accessible and transparent machine learning methods. Selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study.

However, the estimated performance associated with these ML models is likely over-optimistic. Moreover, there is a trend towards using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step towards developing more reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of health outcomes but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.","tags":[],"title":"A Framework for Effective Application of Machine Learning to Microbiome-Based Classification Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc A.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.","tags":[],"title":"Fecal short-chain fatty acids are not predictive of colonic tumor status and cannot be predicted based on bacterial community structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Begüm D.

Abiotic flux of H2 can be very low in these environments, and there is a gap in our knowledge about the origin of CH4 in these habitats. In the hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, growth yields increased as H2 flux, growth rates, and CH4 production rates decreased. The same trend was observed increasingly with interspecies H2 transfer between M. jannaschii and the hyperthermophilic H2 producer Thermococcus paralvinellae With decreasing H2 availability, isotopic fractionation of carbon during methanogenesis increased, resulting in isotopically more negative CH4 with a concomitant decrease in H2-dependent methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase gene expression and increase in F420-dependent methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase gene expression. The significance of our research is in understanding the nature of hyperthermophilic interspecies H2 transfer and identifying biogeochemical and molecular markers for assessing the physiological state of methanogens and possible source of CH4 in natural environments.","tags":[],"title":"Growth Kinetics, Carbon Isotope Fractionation, and Gene Expression in the Hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus jannaschii during Hydrogen-Limited Growth and Interspecies Hydrogen Transfer","type":"publication"}]
